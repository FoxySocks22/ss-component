Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.</p>

        <p>Concertina barriers are relatively new to the safety scene and are a great solution for indoor portable barrier requirements. They are therefore very popular with electrical contractors, cleaners and maintenance workers who need a lightweight, compact and most importantly easy to transport pedestrian barrier. Two of these barricades can easily be used to restrict access to an aisle in a supermarket whilst cleaning is taking place, and then very easily stored in a cupboard or cleaning cupboard ready for use another time without taking up too much space.</p>
